# codegen-tool

## Introduction

This is a tool that uses [`react-native-codegen`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-codegen) to generate native code that can be used with JSI. It takes a given `flow` schema and converts it into native modules - those are interfaces that can be implemented in order to create a custom native logic that can be called from React Native javascript code through JSI.

You can find codegen's code [here](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/ac7ba3ea16472d5eb05a7a27f6b8fa57eb844d04/packages/react-native-codegen).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository
2. `cd codegen-tool`
3. `yarn`
4. `yarn gen-flow` for the flow schema or `yarn gen-ts` for the TypeScript schema(TS seems to be not supported for now)
5. if everything's ok, you'll be able to see the results in `generated` subdirectory

### Patch

The patch for `react-native-codegen` has been added as those were the changes that made this code work in a real project. Feel free to remove it so you can see the code generated by the original codegen tool!

### Final Notes

AFAIK the codegen tool isn't official yet, this repository is for people who'd like to try JSI/codegen functionalities, even if a single person finds somthing that will help them, it was worth it!

This is a draft README and it's going to be improved probably, feel free to post PRs or issues, any suggestions are golden :v:
